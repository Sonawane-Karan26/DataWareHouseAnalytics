# SQL Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Analytics Project**, a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed to demonstrate advanced data analysis techniques. 
This project showcases real-world scenarios, emphasizing best practices in SQL for data exploration, segmentation, and reporting.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **datasets/**: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- **scripts/**: Houses the SQL scripts categorized into:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - **Advanced Data Analytics**
- **docs/**: Documentation and supporting materials.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*"Understand the Data"*

This section focuses on initial data examination to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.

- ‚úÖ **Basic Queries**: Simple SELECT statements, filtering with WHERE, and sorting using ORDER BY.
- ‚úÖ **Data Profiling**: COUNTs, DISTINCT values, NULL checks, and pattern detection using LIKE and IS NULL.
- ‚úÖ **Simple Aggregations**: Use of SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX to gain quick insights.
- ‚úÖ **Subqueries**: Applied for nested filtering and step-by-step data refinement.

## üìä Advanced Data Analytics
*"Answer Business Questions"*
Delving deeper into the data to extract meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

- ‚úÖ **Complex Queries**: Multi-table JOINs, conditional logic with CASE WHEN, and advanced filters.
- ‚úÖ **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, and other analytic functions for grouped data.
- ‚úÖ **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Modular SQL structures to break down complex logic into readable segments.
- ‚úÖ **Subqueries**: Embedded queries for KPIs, trend analysis, and data comparison.
- ‚úÖ **Reports**: Well-structured query outputs designed to be consumed by dashboards or stakeholders.
